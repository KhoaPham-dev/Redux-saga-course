    <p>
      If you're having issues with REM REST API or if the server is down for
      some reason, replace your axios default code with this:
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      //axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;<br />axios.defaults.baseURL =
      'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://rem.dbwebb.se/api';
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      You'll be able to carry on working as normal with no further modifications
      required to your code.<strong> </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Please note the commented out 'withCredentials' line.</strong>
