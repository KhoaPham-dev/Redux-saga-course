    <h4><strong>Attention!</strong></h4>
    <h4>Required settings</h4>
    <p>
      As of February 2020, chrome has blocked cross-site cookies by default
      which means the REM Rest API&nbsp;will no longer work. To get around this
      go to <strong>chrome://flags/</strong> in a new tab in chrome, then
      disable the following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>SameSite by default cookies</p></li>
      <li><p>Enable removing SameSite=None cookies</p></li>
      <li><p>Cookies without SameSite must be secure</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Project setup</h4>
    <p>
      The next 2 lectures will cover setting up a new create-react-app project
      and setting up the redux actions. If you want to get straight into the
      redux sagas, then feel free to skip over these next two lectures and head
      to lecture 5: First saga - watchers, workers, and "takeEvery".
