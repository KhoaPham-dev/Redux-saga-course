      ✨Also a quick note that udemy have multiple prompts throughout the course
      to leave a rating and / or review. This is entirely optional but I would
      really appreciate it if you left a rating and / or review. It takes 2
      seconds to leave a rating and it would mean the world to me if you could
      do that :) ✨
